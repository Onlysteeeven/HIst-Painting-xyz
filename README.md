Historical Description. Chic and simplistic, Damien Hirst's Flumequine, 2007 is a vibrant and eye-catching grid of colored dots in a rectangular field of white. Nine columns and twelve rows of these dots rendered in bright colors from across the color wheel are methodically placed evenly throughout the composition.
